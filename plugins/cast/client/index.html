This shows a very simple receiver to help you get code up and running. You can
think of this as your first step. It is not compatible with our UX guidelines.
It is useful for learning the basic concepts of the system.

  While this receiver doesn't have any text, it's important to know that
  Chromecast defaults to a black background with black text.  Changing that will
  help your efforts.

  We find that having everything fit in the HTML boxes tends to look nicer on TV
  so, we also set overflow: hidden, which clips all flowing outside of boxes or
  adding of scrollbars, which aren't useful on TV.
